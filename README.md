    - Create a file in this repo named `rps.js`
    - Write a function that takes `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors` as an argument for the user choose, then chooses `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors` randomly for the computer choose, and returns whether the user `win`, `lose`, or `tie.
    - Example: `playGame('rock') // Computer picked: paper. User picked: rock.  User lose.`
    - _**Hint:** Javascript includes a `Math.random` method._

2. Dice Roller
    - Create a file in this repo and name it `dice.js`
    - Write a function that chooses two random numbers (1-6) and returns them. It should also return the sum.
    - Example: `rollDice() // Dice rolled are 6 and 1.  Sum is 7`
    - BONUS: have your function take an argument of the # of dice to be rolled.
    - Example: `rollDice(3) // Dice rolled are 4, 2, and 7.  Sum is 13.`
